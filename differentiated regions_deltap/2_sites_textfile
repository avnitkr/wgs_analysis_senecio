#for use as -sites argument in ANGSD allele frequency calculation step

#making a text file version of the variable sites in the .mafs.gz file (just want contig snp major minor)
zcat chr_nine-SNPs.mafs.gz | awk 'NR!=1{print $1"\t"$2"\t"$3"\t"$4}' > chr_nine-SNPs.txt

#sorting the sites file by column 1
sort -k1 chr_nine-SNPs.txt > chr_nine-SNPs-sorted.txt


###issue that may arise during indexing and here is the solution!!!

#Turns out was just a sorting problem both on the cluster and locally. Instead of running:
#sort -k1 myfile > sorted.myfile
#I had to do:
#sort -k 1 -n -b -f -t $'\t' myfile > sorted.myfile
#Then I did not have any problem indexing it.
