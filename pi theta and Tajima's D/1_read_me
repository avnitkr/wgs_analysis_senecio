#this script will NOT filter on Maf as we want to keep all positions to calculate thetas statistics.
#It will simply filter on coverage.It calculates the saf, 1DSFS and thetas statistics by population.
#Beware if ancestral sequenc is the reference (folded spectrum), not all stats are meaningful.
#In my case , I am using reference as ancestral-- which makes site frequency spectrum folded.
#For a folded site frequency spectrum - theta Watterson,theta Tajima and Tajima's D are interpretable!!
